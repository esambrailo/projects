**Exporatory Data Analysis for Global Warming**
During my coursework in the W200 Introduction to Data Science Programming at UC Berkeley's MIDS program, I led a team in analyzing long-term temperature and greenhouse gas emissions data from sources like Berkeley Earth and the United Nations. Utilizing numpy and pandas, our project focused on the correlation between emissions and temperature changes across different geographic locations. We enhanced our analysis with geospatial visualizations to clearly depict regional temperature changes and anomalies, presenting complex data in an understandable format. Our concise findings, presented through a detailed report and brief presentation, were well-received, earning high marks and demonstrating our capability to derive meaningful insights from extensive climate data.
